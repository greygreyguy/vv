<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Please tell us about Yourself</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a youthful yet experienced 27 year old Professional British Dominatrix, hedonist and long term lifestyle kinkster and serial sadist from Derby. I discovered the sex industry when I was at university; watching ‘Secret Diaries of a Call Girl’ starring Billie Piper, I thought, ‘I could do that. It could be fun’. Who knew where it would lead?</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Subsequently, I worked as a kinky escort for a couple of years whilst I learned the business, and then graduated to becoming a fully fledged Dominatrix in my eyes at 22, in 2014. I have had 4 double set playspaces over the years in the East Midlands, in a penthouse apartment and outbuildings. They were extensively equipped, as I am an avid toy collector, but not on the scale I had long envisaged. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2016, I finally acquired Celestial Studios, my project of a lifetime. I have been working extremely hard for the past 3 years, with the help of my incredible subs, slaves, sissies, friends and family to take a 400 year old warehouse that was totally bare and falling to pieces, and turn it into a kinky palace of debauchery. I am excessively proud to say that ‘WE DID IT!’ Celestial Studios is a one of a kind play space with several USP’s. The sets include:</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Barbie’s Sissy Parlour</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My collared sissy has worked tirelessly on the studio for the past three years, so I thought it only fair to name the Sissy Suite after her. Contains: Full crossdressing attire, lingerie, breasts, shoes, wigs, gloves and accessories. Various anal training and chastity toys. Soft furnishings and a dressing screen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Correction Cell</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq steel barred cell with locking door. Contains: pillory, scold’s bridle, steel bunk, suspension gibbet cage and manual hoist. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Cuckold Chamber</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">9m sq bedroom with 4 poster adjustable steel bondage bed with stocks, drapes and a detachable spanking bar.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Dressing Parlour</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Walk in wardrobe filled with crossdressing attire. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Dungeon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">84m sq dungeon with mood lighting and Bose sound system. Apparatus includes: A frame, bed, cages, CBT gallows, Fetters spanking bench, F Machine &amp; mirror, orgasm tower (steel), single bar cage, St. Andrew’s Cross, throne, trample board and more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Medical Suite</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq mirrored ceiling chamber with mood lighting. Dental chair or Gynae bench and steel sink  </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Padded Cell (opening March 2020)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A white anti-escalation cell, complete with fully padded pu leather walls and floor. Ideal for sensory deprivation and extended confinement.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Pony Arena with Stable</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">48m sq of sandy Manège with dressage letters and jump. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6m sq stable with basic tack, rubber matting and shavings </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The Red Room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In homage to 50 Shades of Grey, We have a space with a SuperKing bed, and all manner of BDSM toys, including: canes, crops, floggers, paddles, whips, a fucking machine and other more intimate goodies. This is very popular with swingers and adult models who wish to hire a film/playspace</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Schoolroom</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq with blackboard, dunce corner, library, rocking horse, vintage leather top desk &amp; implements </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Shibari Suspension Suite </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">65m sq with suspension frame and other pieces to be added as work progresses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is my dream come true, and allows me to make the fantasies of all my boys and girls a reality; what could possibly be better than that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the next few years, I hope Celestial Studios becomes a bubbling hub for all manner of fetish/kink positive and swinging events in the East Midlands. I celebrated the opening party of the studio on Friday 13th December 2019, and it was a raging success. All the guests loved the performances, the organisation, the space and the complimentary food, drinks and goodie bags. I am hosting the next big extravaganza in March. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How did You get into being a Pro Domme?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From being 6/7 years old, I would watch films such as Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur. This meant that I started to bubble inside when I bore witness to a whipping scene, a person in chains, punishment and class divides. My earliest fetish moment that I can remember is being 11 years old, standing on my bed and pretending that I had been captured and become a slave in a foreign land, taken away from my family and was about to be sold at a slave auction. I would envisage the faces and leering eyes of the traders as they bid on me, and I would then imagine being taken away in chains, thrust myself down on the bed and proceeded to rub myself on the mattress and it felt really good. After that, well, I have always been a highly sexed and hedonistic creature, and using my mind and body to entice, punish and manipulate individuals into indulging me sexually has always been the perfect fit for me. I am a sexual sadist, and have been both a submissive and switch in scenes previously, so I have plenty of experiences of my own to draw from when I am empathising with my subs, sissies, slaves, and bottoms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How long have You been a Pro Domme and have You seen many changes in that time?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had earned my stripes and became a well known Professional Dominatrix in 2014 after keeping my head down for a couple of years, taking my time to learn the ropes and develop my own style. I never had a mentor initially, although I have several now, nor did I meet any other Dominant Ladies until 2014, when I met Dirk from <a href="http://kinkymistresses.com/">KinkyMistresses.com</a>. He liked my look and style and invited me to shoot together in Germany. We made some fabulous content, and I realised that being in front of a camera, as well as doing a private session in my dungeon was a calling for me. Dirk introduced me to some amazing mistresses such as: Mistress Johanna, Mistress Susi, Ezada Sinn and Lilse Von Hitte etcetera. Once I began shooting for some of the bigger FemDom companies, Dirk then put me forward to go and work at the English Mansion with Mistress Sidonia Von Bork for The English Mansion, and it has been my honour to film with Her and Dominant Dolly several times over the years, and Mistress Sidonia definitely holds a very special place in my heart. She, along with Domina Liza, Domina Sara, Mistress Amrita, Mistress Athena, Mistress Celeste, Mistress Eclipse, Mistress Inka, Mistress Julia Taylor, Mistress Lilse Von Hitte and many other incredible Ladies have inspired me and helped me to learn and grow as a Lady, and as a human. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am not hugely into scene parties (unless I am organising them, as I am a bit of a control freak) so I cannot comment too much on the changes within our contemporary BDSM society. I have noticed an emergence of independent content from models and sex workers which is really exciting, and the advance of technology has meant that VR porn is becoming possible; I did my first scene recently for The English Mansion. I believe it is now live on their site, which is well worth subscribing to for the creme de la creme of FemDom porn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I would also say that OnlyFans is an extremely interesting resource, one that I intend to delve further into forthwith. There are some amazing parties around these days; I particularly enjoy Torture Garden Brighton, as I am honoured to rope bunny for the amazing Mistress Amrita on occasion, TG Edinburgh, &amp; The FemDom Ball. ZDR parties and The German Fetish Weekend are on my to do list for 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My own developments and self awarensss have been significant since I began in this amazing world. Being 20 when I started out, I was young and voracious. I have since learnt to (somewhat) temper my appetite, and my own expectations of myself, so as not to over stretch and burn out. I have an amazing set of long term kinky friends and mentors who are instrumental in my learning and development; there are too many to list. I feel that I have grown into a successful entrepreneur in my own right, and force to be reckoned with, both physically and psychosocially.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is it that makes You different from the others?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My brain. I am extremely emotionally intelligent, intuitive, versatile and KIND. I have an insatiable desire to please and care for others. I am usually the life and soul of the party, very fun and pretty popular, but also creatively sadistic. I have the best team behind me that I have selected and earned over a period of several years. I focus on helping each individual and showing love, and that is why I now possess one of the best studios around, the most all encompassing custom fetish space I have ever seen. I go big or go home. I am unpredictable. I am witty and sharp. I am also an all natural English rose with no tattoos (a rarity) who is equally comfortable in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot or Download Heavy Metal Festival (I attend these, and other events with my fabulous subbies).</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a hedonist, not merely a Dominant. I am a predator, I take what I want. I am greedy. I adore women and have several submissive girlfriends who I play and film with often. I am pretty skilled with a whip, thanks to Tony Essentia and Domina Sara for their continued tuition, love and guidance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love getting my hands dirty. I have a space at Celestial Studios for every fetish, my toy collection is epic. I have an outfit collection that far exceeds my years in the business. I understand addiction, having struggled with gambling, sex, food and drugs in the past. I am a great role model as I have come through so much adversity and continue to triumph. I am a force to be reckoned with, and intimidate most people with my old soul, killer curves and razor sharp tongue, but I am also a genuine, sometimes humble, kind and loving lady who lives this as a lifestyle, both as a Domme and as a sub, as I believe the dynamic with each individual person needs to be completely subjective, and I love to tick all of my multiple personalities’ boxes. You only get one life after all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">When did You first realise You were a Dominant Female, and when did the knowledge manifest itself?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have always been a leader. At school and in all extracurricular activities and sports, (of which there were a few, as I was pushed hard, and had the cliched Irish catholic upbringing), I was always team captain. I was, and am, talented, sympathetic, a great team player, supportive but fierce and set a good example to have courage and strength. I dominated my GCSE and A Level exams with 12A* and a B in German, and all As at A Level. I ran my own choir at school. My dogs are impeccably well behaved because they are never alone (that’s what house boys are for, right?), and also because I train them through love and encouragement, rather than mere retribution. I am the leader of the pack. It’s in my blood.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What would You say is the prime attribute that makes You a Dominant Woman?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pure empathy. It can be a curse, as I often struggle to disassociate myself with my wards’ trials and tribulations, but I love to be helpful and to improve attitude and self worth. I also love to see those under my tuition succeed and triumph. I am a fixer of birds with broken wings, and have several success stories to my name. One of which is my house slave, who has become a man, and the remarkable improvements to his life that we have achieved together make me feel proud every day. Slave John, Barbie, Pebbles, Dobby, Jocelyn Jane and all the babies make me so proud and I love you all dearly. I would be in limbo without you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am also a sadist; I get a surge of adrenaline and pure endorphins/dopamine when I use the whip, paddle, cane, flogger etc. I adore concocting rituals where my masochists suffer deliciously for me, but never push them over the edge. I am essentially a therapist and a matriarch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Do Your slaves come from any particular area of society or is it a cross section?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My slaves all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they are completely across the board, from professors and pilots to more blue collar professionals. I see ladies infrequently too, and have a collection of gorgeous couples that I session with too. I mainly session in Derby, so am well situated for people travelling from all over the country. I often visit Edinburgh too, and have a plethora of interesting and gorgeous subbies that I session with up North.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I enjoy dominating men and women, but I do prefer sexual acts with a woman, such as kissing and penetration; we are so much more beautiful and sensuous. I love seeing couples, and have recently met one who I want be their permanent third wheel, so let’s see how that goes!</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What kinds of punishments do You use?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This ranges from sensory deprivation and being caged and ignored to sadistic corporal punishment, electrics, to being humiliated or enjoying some forced bi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a VAST array of punishment equipment, and am currently having a rack made for my prison cell. I possess all manner of canes, tawse, paddles, floggers, whips, etc. My studio is one of the most comprehensibly equipped I have ever seen, and I am relatively well travelled, having done the fetish touring and scene in Germany, much of Europe and Florida on a good few occasions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is Your favourite fetish?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fur, Boots, Rope, Leather and Breath Play (in that order)</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What does a D/S relationship look like to You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go on forever going into the particulars of the varying dynamics I have with my boys and girls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let me focus solely on my collared slaves and sissies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We speak daily or very regularly. They are useful and I police their education and development, encouraging and rewarding good deeds and achievements, driving them forward towards the goals we have set together, and punishing them in a suitable and deterring fashion when they fall short of my expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If someone asked You to take them past their limits, would You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All aspects of BDSM are progressive. I don’t use safe words, as I don’t feel that I need them, and I believe that a true dominant is able to ease through limits and address them safely, sympathetically and gradually, and over time the limits are surpassed in a pleasure and proud manner. We then continue to work upwards, and with trust, truth and understanding, I feel that all ceilings can be broken through if the sub is willing. If they are not, then we change onto something more enjoyable for all, unless there has been a prior agreement to test the sub fiercely.  I always stress to mistresses and kinksters who come to me for advice to take their time and regularly assess reactions. It is better to leave a slave wanting you to push them a little further in a future session/scene rather than have them running for the hills, for everyone’s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How important is aftercare to You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before, during and after session care is at the heart of everything I believe in. I was lucky enough to be invited to be a presenter at the Rome BDSM Conference a few years ago; my seminar was centred around gauging reaction, subjectivity and aftercare. All manner of care throughout and afterwards is fundamental. There are several post scene considerations which must be accounted for immediately after a scene (emotionally or physically), and provisions for a delayed onset reaction/sub-drop must be catered for. I always keep blankets and sugary items nearby, and obviously the Dominant should already be made aware of any pre existing medical conditions, both physically and psychologically, before engaging in any play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Is there anything in the BDSM world that You haven’t done yet that You wish You could do?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would like to shoot with <a href="http://kink.com/">Kink.com</a> and Club Dom in the future, and some of my favourite riggers, both as a rigger and a bunny. Rope is a real love of mine. You can never really conquer or exhaust it as a stimulating resource. I would also like to hit some more fetish weekends such as Montreal, and to host a French Chateau style party one day, like in ‘The Story of O’. I have so many things on my to do list, I won’t bore you with them all! I am a greedy Goddess.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How do You perceive the lifestyles as being viewed by mainstream society?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I recently had my studio opening party in December, and I invited a cross section of my vanilla and kink friends to join me at CS. We had around 70 guests, varying from equestrians, dental practitioners, school and uni friends, as well as sissies, masochists, mistresses, crossdressers, people into feet. It was a scream, and everyone was super respectful and curious. Some vanilla, or new to kink friends as I prefer to call them, watched in awe at Christian Red’s rope performance and the fire demos, some got involved and enjoyed some new activities, but everyone was fascinated. A friend of mine was saying to me only last night in fact, as we are discussing arranging a high end swinging party over the coming months, that all vanilla people, no matter whether they like it or not, find some aspects of BDSM sexy, whether to watch or participate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am completely proud of my profession and vocation, am always open and honest with all my friends, family, and strangers who I meet, and they all seem fascinated and impressed, some are even quite envious. Everyone has a million questions about all aspects of the industry, I dispel myths and confirm legends, and usually we depart with them having a new found respect for kinksters and sex workers. I am an advocate in the civilian world for all of us filth monsters. The world is changing outlook for the better, and becoming ever more accepting of their own, and our desires. I am truly proud of all we have achieved as a scene and a community, and hope that we can continue to engage, enlighten and inspire others to get out of their box and into the pit of perversity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How do You feel about the way that Pro Dommes get portrayed in the media?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speaking from my own personal experiences, I have always been treated with respect by any mainstream media companies; I have been approached by both TV and radio on a number of occasions to take part in documentaries, and in the past I have always politely declined, as I want to make sure that I was confident that this was to be my profession for life before diving in, nor do I have any desire to force myself on people who may not necessarily want to hear about all my kinky exploits, little old ladies listening to BBC Radio Derby for example. I thought I would spare them my debauchery, however, I feel that women are being inspired and empowered both by the online and more old school media platforms, and I feel that the media are taking an increasingly inclusive and exciting view of our world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Do You consider Yourself as being a Dominatrix in all aspects of Your life or do You separate this from a more vanilla life?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have multiple personalities, all under the same exterior umbrella, and I love all parts of myself these days; that only came with time, understanding and deep soul searching to reach complete acceptance, especially in a world where we are constantly faced with airbrushed images and the media’s warped concept of beauty and perfection. I am a normal girl who enjoys the outdoors and having everyday fun with friends and family, but most of the time, I am bossy and strong.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my personal life, I have several relationships and consider myself to be poly-amorous. I have relationships with couples, sub girls, collared slaves, other mistresses both as a fellow top, and as their sub in a few cases, so I would say that although I can be many different things to different people in my life, I am always open and honest and don’t have to hide anything from my friends or family. The gory details are kept secret, of course, but I am an exhibitionist at heart, a vigilante, and a pioneer in that I ingratiate people into my life, and they must then accept all sides of me. In the studio, in session or on film, I am always Goddess Vivienne, but in private, I can be a slutty sub girl, a completely vanilla snuggle muffin, or a bratty 27 year old princess who wants the world and won’t stop until she gets it.</span></p>

<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What do You like to do in Your spare time?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a complete workaholic so have very little spare time, between managing session applications, sessions, correspondence, social media marketing and management, my collared slaves and their daily needs, my parties and the studio renovations, I have little time to relax. I get so many emails and am blessed with several wonderful subs, so I have to keep up or my phone can quickly get on top of me, and I am always super focussed on keeping up so as not to offend anyone. Sometimes, I can’t manage to get back to everyone as urgently as they would like, but my close ones have all been forced to learn patience since serving me. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love golf, horse riding, fishing, outdoor swimming and hiking with the dogs. I love all competitive sport and can hold my own against the lads in most things. I am also an avid reader, musician and do some modelling and writing when I can, both poetry and prose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Besides Your love of all things domination, what are Your other loves in life?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My dogs, Diesel and Beryl, who share my bed every night. They are my world. My friends and family. I am blessed with more than two hands full of incredibly talented, beautiful and inspirational friends and role models whom I adore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If You were not doing this, what other career would You like to have?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is nothing I would rather do. Period. I have the qualifications to become a laywer, or go back to uni to do veterinary science or marine biology, which I love, but I think I would be a scholar or have a dog boarding kennels or maybe work in a mental asylum. Being a poker dealer in Cancun, Mexico at a friend’s casino would be quite fun too!</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What satisfies You the most about being a mistress?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love the ease of life. I have a kinky family who always make sure I want for nothing. They are incredible. I love the prestige that my clips and studio have achieved. I love the positive impact that I have on so many lives. I love being able to be my most arrogant self, and to be loved and worshipped for it. I never have to lie or pretend or hide; I am proud of myself because of those who serve me. Without them, I am nothing.</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is Your personal motivation to work as a Dominatrix?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nobody does it quite like me. I have a very special mind and enigmatic soul, or so I am told. If Vivienne l’Amour and Celestial Studios weren’t in Derby, I think the world would be a poorer place. </span></p>
