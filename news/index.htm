			<p>After 3 amazing sessions with Goddess over the last couple of years, I thought I had experienced the very best of what BDSM has to offer to me. However, as Goddess says Herself, She likes to take things a bit further each time and today She certainly again surpassed what I believed to be perfection already!</p>

			<p>As I was met with a smile and quickly introduced to my other sub kiki for todays session. It started off with us both being tied up facing each other. The closeness was great and things stated to stir. Before we got to comfortable miss Vivienne started ensuring we were behaving with a few strikes of the paddle and whip. This started to get the juices going before Miss harder on kiki more than me. I held her tight and she to me. After this we were made to lie on the floor being tied together in such a way that if I moved I would cause pain to kiki but she had a free hand and was ordered to masturbate in front of my eyes, superb. It was not over as we were released just before she came. Wow what came next I was told to put on a strapon and with kiki lying on the table told to use it as if it were mine. Well going for it by going deep caused kiki to squirm a few times but i did get it all in. It then time for the reverse as kiki wore it and she get her own back. All this time Miss Viviene ensured we obeyed her instructions on what to do. Finally after being sat on by Miss I was allowed to come. What an experience that was and I thanked them both for the session</p>

<p>Every single day since mid-July You have been on my mind and in my heart. When I go to bed, when running, when relaxing. I love it, you are like the essence of life and whenever my mind touches you, I feel elevated, calm and a little thrilled all at the same time...</p>

			<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Please tell us about Yourself</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a youthful yet experienced 27 year old Professional British Dominatrix, hedonist and long term lifestyle kinkster and serial sadist from Derby. I discovered the sex industry when I was at university; watching ‘Secret Diaries of a Call Girl’ starring Billie Piper, I thought, ‘I could do that. It could be fun’. Who knew where it would lead?</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Subsequently, I worked as a kinky escort for a couple of years whilst I learned the business, and then graduated to becoming a fully fledged Dominatrix in my eyes at 22, in 2014. I have had 4 double set playspaces over the years in the East Midlands, in a penthouse apartment and outbuildings. They were extensively equipped, as I am an avid toy collector, but not on the scale I had long envisaged. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2016, I finally acquired Celestial Studios, my project of a lifetime. I have been working extremely hard for the past 3 years, with the help of my incredible subs, slaves, sissies, friends and family to take a 400 year old warehouse that was totally bare and falling to pieces, and turn it into a kinky palace of debauchery. I am excessively proud to say that ‘WE DID IT!’ Celestial Studios is a one of a kind play space with several USP’s. The sets include:</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Barbie’s Sissy Parlour</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My collared sissy has worked tirelessly on the studio for the past three years, so I thought it only fair to name the Sissy Suite after her. Contains: Full crossdressing attire, lingerie, breasts, shoes, wigs, gloves and accessories. Various anal training and chastity toys. Soft furnishings and a dressing screen. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Correction Cell</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq steel barred cell with locking door. Contains: pillory, scold’s bridle, steel bunk, suspension gibbet cage and manual hoist. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Cuckold Chamber</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">9m sq bedroom with 4 poster adjustable steel bondage bed with stocks, drapes and a detachable spanking bar.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Dressing Parlour</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Walk in wardrobe filled with crossdressing attire. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Dungeon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">84m sq dungeon with mood lighting and Bose sound system. Apparatus includes: A frame, bed, cages, CBT gallows, Fetters spanking bench, F Machine &amp; mirror, orgasm tower (steel), single bar cage, St. Andrew’s Cross, throne, trample board and more.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Medical Suite</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq mirrored ceiling chamber with mood lighting. Dental chair or Gynae bench and steel sink  </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Padded Cell (opening March 2020)</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A white anti-escalation cell, complete with fully padded pu leather walls and floor. Ideal for sensory deprivation and extended confinement.  </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Pony Arena with Stable</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">48m sq of sandy Manège with dressage letters and jump. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6m sq stable with basic tack, rubber matting and shavings </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul2">
<li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">The Red Room</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In homage to 50 Shades of Grey, We have a space with a SuperKing bed, and all manner of BDSM toys, including: canes, crops, floggers, paddles, whips, a fucking machine and other more intimate goodies. This is very popular with swingers and adult models who wish to hire a film/playspace</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Schoolroom</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">12m sq with blackboard, dunce corner, library, rocking horse, vintage leather top desk &amp; implements </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Shibari Suspension Suite </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">65m sq with suspension frame and other pieces to be added as work progresses.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is my dream come true, and allows me to make the fantasies of all my boys and girls a reality; what could possibly be better than that?</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the next few years, I hope Celestial Studios becomes a bubbling hub for all manner of fetish/kink positive and swinging events in the East Midlands. I celebrated the opening party of the studio on Friday 13th December 2019, and it was a raging success. All the guests loved the performances, the organisation, the space and the complimentary food, drinks and goodie bags. I am hosting the next big extravaganza in March. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am also super excited to announce that Domina Liza and I will be pioneering a new event called ‘Amazonia - Where Women Become Warriors’ on 16th Feb, aimed at everyone who is interested in playing in a FemDom environment. I have just finished the advert for Fetlife and the mailing list. Here are the details:</span></p>

<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We look forward to seeing You all there.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How did You get into being a Pro Domme?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From being 6/7 years old, I would watch films such as Braveheart, Spartacus and Ben Hur. This meant that I started to bubble inside when I bore witness to a whipping scene, a person in chains, punishment and class divides. My earliest fetish moment that I can remember is being 11 years old, standing on my bed and pretending that I had been captured and become a slave in a foreign land, taken away from my family and was about to be sold at a slave auction. I would envisage the faces and leering eyes of the traders as they bid on me, and I would then imagine being taken away in chains, thrust myself down on the bed and proceeded to rub myself on the mattress and it felt really good. After that, well, I have always been a highly sexed and hedonistic creature, and using my mind and body to entice, punish and manipulate individuals into indulging me sexually has always been the perfect fit for me. I am a sexual sadist, and have been both a submissive and switch in scenes previously, so I have plenty of experiences of my own to draw from when I am empathising with my subs, sissies, slaves, and bottoms.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How long have You been a Pro Domme and have You seen many changes in that time?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had earned my stripes and became a well known Professional Dominatrix in 2014 after keeping my head down for a couple of years, taking my time to learn the ropes and develop my own style. I never had a mentor initially, although I have several now, nor did I meet any other Dominant Ladies until 2014, when I met Dirk from <a href="http://kinkymistresses.com/">KinkyMistresses.com</a>. He liked my look and style and invited me to shoot together in Germany. We made some fabulous content, and I realised that being in front of a camera, as well as doing a private session in my dungeon was a calling for me. Dirk introduced me to some amazing mistresses such as: Mistress Johanna, Mistress Susi, Ezada Sinn and Lilse Von Hitte etcetera. Once I began shooting for some of the bigger FemDom companies, Dirk then put me forward to go and work at the English Mansion with Mistress Sidonia Von Bork for The English Mansion, and it has been my honour to film with Her and Dominant Dolly several times over the years, and Mistress Sidonia definitely holds a very special place in my heart. She, along with Domina Liza, Domina Sara, Mistress Amrita, Mistress Athena, Mistress Celeste, Mistress Eclipse, Mistress Inka, Mistress Julia Taylor, Mistress Lilse Von Hitte and many other incredible Ladies have inspired me and helped me to learn and grow as a Lady, and as a human. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am not hugely into scene parties (unless I am organising them, as I am a bit of a control freak) so I cannot comment too much on the changes within our contemporary BDSM society. I have noticed an emergence of independent content from models and sex workers which is really exciting, and the advance of technology has meant that VR porn is becoming possible; I did my first scene recently for The English Mansion. I believe it is now live on their site, which is well worth subscribing to for the creme de la creme of FemDom porn.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> I would also say that OnlyFans is an extremely interesting resource, one that I intend to delve further into forthwith. There are some amazing parties around these days; I particularly enjoy Torture Garden Brighton, as I am honoured to rope bunny for the amazing Mistress Amrita on occasion, TG Edinburgh, &amp; The FemDom Ball. ZDR parties and The German Fetish Weekend are on my to do list for 2020.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My own developments and self awarensss have been significant since I began in this amazing world. Being 20 when I started out, I was young and voracious. I have since learnt to (somewhat) temper my appetite, and my own expectations of myself, so as not to over stretch and burn out. I have an amazing set of long term kinky friends and mentors who are instrumental in my learning and development; there are too many to list. I feel that I have grown into a successful entrepreneur in my own right, and force to be reckoned with, both physically and psychosocially.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is it that makes You different from the others?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My brain. I am extremely emotionally intelligent, intuitive, versatile and KIND. I have an insatiable desire to please and care for others. I am usually the life and soul of the party, very fun and pretty popular, but also creatively sadistic. I have the best team behind me that I have selected and earned over a period of several years. I focus on helping each individual and showing love, and that is why I now possess one of the best studios around, the most all encompassing custom fetish space I have ever seen. I go big or go home. I am unpredictable. I am witty and sharp. I am also an all natural English rose with no tattoos (a rarity) who is equally comfortable in the Royal Enclosure at Ascot or Download Heavy Metal Festival (I attend these, and other events with my fabulous subbies).</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a hedonist, not merely a Dominant. I am a predator, I take what I want. I am greedy. I adore women and have several submissive girlfriends who I play and film with often. I am pretty skilled with a whip, thanks to Tony Essentia and Domina Sara for their continued tuition, love and guidance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love getting my hands dirty. I have a space at Celestial Studios for every fetish, my toy collection is epic. I have an outfit collection that far exceeds my years in the business. I understand addiction, having struggled with gambling, sex, food and drugs in the past. I am a great role model as I have come through so much adversity and continue to triumph. I am a force to be reckoned with, and intimidate most people with my old soul, killer curves and razor sharp tongue, but I am also a genuine, sometimes humble, kind and loving lady who lives this as a lifestyle, both as a Domme and as a sub, as I believe the dynamic with each individual person needs to be completely subjective, and I love to tick all of my multiple personalities’ boxes. You only get one life after all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">When did You first realise You were a Dominant Female, and when did the knowledge manifest itself?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have always been a leader. At school and in all extracurricular activities and sports, (of which there were a few, as I was pushed hard, and had the cliched Irish catholic upbringing), I was always team captain. I was, and am, talented, sympathetic, a great team player, supportive but fierce and set a good example to have courage and strength. I dominated my GCSE and A Level exams with 12A* and a B in German, and all As at A Level. I ran my own choir at school. My dogs are impeccably well behaved because they are never alone (that’s what house boys are for, right?), and also because I train them through love and encouragement, rather than mere retribution. I am the leader of the pack. It’s in my blood.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What would You say is the prime attribute that makes You a Dominant Woman?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pure empathy. It can be a curse, as I often struggle to disassociate myself with my wards’ trials and tribulations, but I love to be helpful and to improve attitude and self worth. I also love to see those under my tuition succeed and triumph. I am a fixer of birds with broken wings, and have several success stories to my name. One of which is my house slave, who has become a man, and the remarkable improvements to his life that we have achieved together make me feel proud every day. Slave John, Barbie, Pebbles, Dobby, Jocelyn Jane and all the babies make me so proud and I love you all dearly. I would be in limbo without you.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am also a sadist; I get a surge of adrenaline and pure endorphins/dopamine when I use the whip, paddle, cane, flogger etc. I adore concocting rituals where my masochists suffer deliciously for me, but never push them over the edge. I am essentially a therapist and a matriarch.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Do Your slaves come from any particular area of society or is it a cross section?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My slaves all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but they are completely across the board, from professors and pilots to more blue collar professionals. I see ladies infrequently too, and have a collection of gorgeous couples that I session with too. I mainly session in Derby, so am well situated for people travelling from all over the country. I often visit Edinburgh too, and have a plethora of interesting and gorgeous subbies that I session with up North.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I enjoy dominating men and women, but I do prefer sexual acts with a woman, such as kissing and penetration; we are so much more beautiful and sensuous. I love seeing couples, and have recently met one who I want be their permanent third wheel, so let’s see how that goes!</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What kinds of punishments do You use?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This ranges from sensory deprivation and being caged and ignored to sadistic corporal punishment, electrics, to being humiliated or enjoying some forced bi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have a VAST array of punishment equipment, and am currently having a rack made for my prison cell. I possess all manner of canes, tawse, paddles, floggers, whips, etc. My studio is one of the most comprehensibly equipped I have ever seen, and I am relatively well travelled, having done the fetish touring and scene in Germany, much of Europe and Florida on a good few occasions. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is Your favourite fetish?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fur, Boots, Rope, Leather and Breath Play (in that order)</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What does a D/S relationship look like to You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I could go on forever going into the particulars of the varying dynamics I have with my boys and girls.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let me focus solely on my collared slaves and sissies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We speak daily or very regularly. They are useful and I police their education and development, encouraging and rewarding good deeds and achievements, driving them forward towards the goals we have set together, and punishing them in a suitable and deterring fashion when they fall short of my expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If someone asked You to take them past their limits, would You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All aspects of BDSM are progressive. I don’t use safe words, as I don’t feel that I need them, and I believe that a true dominant is able to ease through limits and address them safely, sympathetically and gradually, and over time the limits are surpassed in a pleasure and proud manner. We then continue to work upwards, and with trust, truth and understanding, I feel that all ceilings can be broken through if the sub is willing. If they are not, then we change onto something more enjoyable for all, unless there has been a prior agreement to test the sub fiercely.  I always stress to mistresses and kinksters who come to me for advice to take their time and regularly assess reactions. It is better to leave a slave wanting you to push them a little further in a future session/scene rather than have them running for the hills, for everyone’s sake.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How important is aftercare to You?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before, during and after session care is at the heart of everything I believe in. I was lucky enough to be invited to be a presenter at the Rome BDSM Conference a few years ago; my seminar was centred around gauging reaction, subjectivity and aftercare. All manner of care throughout and afterwards is fundamental. There are several post scene considerations which must be accounted for immediately after a scene (emotionally or physically), and provisions for a delayed onset reaction/sub-drop must be catered for. I always keep blankets and sugary items nearby, and obviously the Dominant should already be made aware of any pre existing medical conditions, both physically and psychologically, before engaging in any play.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Is there anything in the BDSM world that You haven’t done yet that You wish You could do?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would like to shoot with <a href="http://kink.com/">Kink.com</a> and Club Dom in the future, and some of my favourite riggers, both as a rigger and a bunny. Rope is a real love of mine. You can never really conquer or exhaust it as a stimulating resource. I would also like to hit some more fetish weekends such as Montreal, and to host a French Chateau style party one day, like in ‘The Story of O’. I have so many things on my to do list, I won’t bore you with them all! I am a greedy Goddess.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How do You perceive the lifestyles as being viewed by mainstream society?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I recently had my studio opening party in December, and I invited a cross section of my vanilla and kink friends to join me at CS. We had around 70 guests, varying from equestrians, dental practitioners, school and uni friends, as well as sissies, masochists, mistresses, crossdressers, people into feet. It was a scream, and everyone was super respectful and curious. Some vanilla, or new to kink friends as I prefer to call them, watched in awe at Christian Red’s rope performance and the fire demos, some got involved and enjoyed some new activities, but everyone was fascinated. A friend of mine was saying to me only last night in fact, as we are discussing arranging a high end swinging party over the coming months, that all vanilla people, no matter whether they like it or not, find some aspects of BDSM sexy, whether to watch or participate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am completely proud of my profession and vocation, am always open and honest with all my friends, family, and strangers who I meet, and they all seem fascinated and impressed, some are even quite envious. Everyone has a million questions about all aspects of the industry, I dispel myths and confirm legends, and usually we depart with them having a new found respect for kinksters and sex workers. I am an advocate in the civilian world for all of us filth monsters. The world is changing outlook for the better, and becoming ever more accepting of their own, and our desires. I am truly proud of all we have achieved as a scene and a community, and hope that we can continue to engage, enlighten and inspire others to get out of their box and into the pit of perversity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">How do You feel about the way that Pro Dommes get portrayed in the media?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speaking from my own personal experiences, I have always been treated with respect by any mainstream media companies; I have been approached by both TV and radio on a number of occasions to take part in documentaries, and in the past I have always politely declined, as I want to make sure that I was confident that this was to be my profession for life before diving in, nor do I have any desire to force myself on people who may not necessarily want to hear about all my kinky exploits, little old ladies listening to BBC Radio Derby for example. I thought I would spare them my debauchery, however, I feel that women are being inspired and empowered both by the online and more old school media platforms, and I feel that the media are taking an increasingly inclusive and exciting view of our world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Do You consider Yourself as being a Dominatrix in all aspects of Your life or do You separate this from a more vanilla life?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have multiple personalities, all under the same exterior umbrella, and I love all parts of myself these days; that only came with time, understanding and deep soul searching to reach complete acceptance, especially in a world where we are constantly faced with airbrushed images and the media’s warped concept of beauty and perfection. I am a normal girl who enjoys the outdoors and having everyday fun with friends and family, but most of the time, I am bossy and strong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In my personal life, I have several relationships and consider myself to be poly-amorous. I have relationships with couples, sub girls, collared slaves, other mistresses both as a fellow top, and as their sub in a few cases, so I would say that although I can be many different things to different people in my life, I am always open and honest and don’t have to hide anything from my friends or family. The gory details are kept secret, of course, but I am an exhibitionist at heart, a vigilante, and a pioneer in that I ingratiate people into my life, and they must then accept all sides of me. In the studio, in session or on film, I am always Goddess Vivienne, but in private, I can be a slutty sub girl, a completely vanilla snuggle muffin, or a bratty 27 year old princess who wants the world and won’t stop until she gets it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What do You like to do in Your spare time?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am a complete workaholic so have very little spare time, between managing session applications, sessions, correspondence, social media marketing and management, my collared slaves and their daily needs, my parties and the studio renovations, I have little time to relax. I get so many emails and am blessed with several wonderful subs, so I have to keep up or my phone can quickly get on top of me, and I am always super focussed on keeping up so as not to offend anyone. Sometimes, I can’t manage to get back to everyone as urgently as they would like, but my close ones have all been forced to learn patience since serving me. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love golf, horse riding, fishing, outdoor swimming and hiking with the dogs. I love all competitive sport and can hold my own against the lads in most things. I am also an avid reader, musician and do some modelling and writing when I can, both poetry and prose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Besides Your love of all things domination, what are Your other loves in life?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My dogs, Diesel and Beryl, who share my bed every night. They are my world. My friends and family. I am blessed with more than two hands full of incredibly talented, beautiful and inspirational friends and role models whom I adore.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">If You were not doing this, what other career would You like to have?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is nothing I would rather do. Period. I have the qualifications to become a laywer, or go back to uni to do veterinary science or marine biology, which I love, but I think I would be a scholar or have a dog boarding kennels or maybe work in a mental asylum. Being a poker dealer in Cancun, Mexico at a friend’s casino would be quite fun too!</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What satisfies You the most about being a mistress?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I love the ease of life. I have a kinky family who always make sure I want for nothing. They are incredible. I love the prestige that my clips and studio have achieved. I love the positive impact that I have on so many lives. I love being able to be my most arrogant self, and to be loved and worshipped for it. I never have to lie or pretend or hide; I am proud of myself because of those who serve me. Without them, I am nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">What is Your personal motivation to work as a Dominatrix?</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nobody does it quite like me. I have a very special mind and enigmatic soul, or so I am told. If Vivienne l’Amour and Celestial Studios weren’t in Derby, I think the world would be a poorer place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">Anything else You would like to mention?</span></li>

			<p><span class="">Dear Goddess,</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">First of all my sincerest apologies that it took me a whole month to write this story, especially as our 3 hour session together was by far the best Domme experience I've ever had; you are such an intuitive and natural Goddess! Although I’m normally not a writer, I had great pleasure putting this down on paper and I hope that this is what you meant when you asked me to share my experiences. I do apologise for my English, as expressing feelings in a non-native language turned out to be hard! </span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">After booking our session for more than a month in advance, the day had finally come. I was going to meet the gorgeous Goddess, trust her with my biggest secrets and give her full control of my body and mind. This was a very big step for me and I couldn’t have been more nervous and excited at the </span><span class="markuphainv5s" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">sam</span><span class="">e time!</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">When I arrived at her professional studio, Goddess had just arrived as well and we went in at the </span><span class="markuphainv5s" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">sam</span><span class="">e time. The beauty of Goddess was overwhelming, but she put me at ease very quickly. After a brief conversation about my do’s and don’ts, Goddess very fluently turned me into her slut slave. We first went into her sissy room and I felt amazed to see her extensive wardrobe. She was sharing her thoughts out loud and had lots of fun, as she was considering what she would make me wear. The one outfit was even more sexy and girly than the other and at this point I knew I was at her mercy and that really turned me on! She finally selected stockings, high heels and decided that I was going to wear a brown leather corset. Although I felt very humiliated, I couldn’t wait to put it on (I have a real fetish for leather, latex and everything shiny and tight!).</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">On our way to the upstairs dungeon, we passed the amazing stables. Immediately I fantasised about how great it would feel to be Goddess’s pony, but Goddess decided that this was not for now. When we arrived to the dungeon, Goddess told me to put on the clothes she picked, complemented with a wig and boobs. At this point I was even passed feeling humiliated! In the meanwhile Goddess changed into a magnificent red leather play suit; what an amazing body! She then helped me into the corset and made sure I wore it as tightly as possible. No additional ropes needed, as I felt totally constrained already. After making me take a good look at my slutty self in the mirror, she guided me towards the wooden frame.</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">When we arrived to the frame, I found myself in quite a predicament. Facing the frame, my arms were tied behind my back in a leather arm binder. A chain with nipple clamps made sure that I couldn’t move away from the frame. Goddess came up with a very genius construction where a rope connected the end of the leather arm binder to a leather parachute tied around my balls and cock. This meant that whenever I moved my arms, I was basically putting strain on my balls. Goddess also made me wear a very pretty gas mask, of which the glass kept steaming up due to all my excitement. While fighting the pain in my calf muscles from having to stand on my sexy high heels, Goddess played me very erotically. I remember her walking around me in her gorgeous red leather suit and me wanting nothing more than touching her, but this was impossible. She kissed my mask with her sexy red lipstick lips, but all I could do was watch. She even made selfies with me in the background. My buttocks also experienced how skilled Goddess is with her stunning, custom made, colourful whip. The pain was masked by the discomfort from the high heels, but with each stroke I felt more powerless and loved Goddess even more! She was clearly having lots of fun and I quickly learned that her lovely laugh meant trouble for me. She decided that I needed to have a girl name and decided that Lagertha would be appropriate for me; a name I shall wear with pride!</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">Goddess decided that it was time to move on to yet another room and released me from the frame (taking away the nipple clamps was beyond painful!). She asked me if I was claustrophobic and when I said that I wasn’t, she put an inflatable leather hood with an integrated breathing tube over my head. I was so happy, because I had always wanted to try one of these on! Unfortunately, probably due to all the excitement, I was breading so heavily that I couldn’t cope with the small tube and while the mask wasn’t even inflated, I had to ask Goddess to take it off. I don’t like giving up, but luckily Goddess had a fantastic alternative. This time a latex mask, without eye openings, but with full mouth access. Another one of my favorites! This way and still fully cross dressed, she guided me through a few doors and pushed me down onto a leather table. When she fixed my legs in gynecological leg holders and my hands at the sides of the table, I realised I was in her medical room. </span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">Laying there, with every part of my body fully accessible to Goddess, was heaven to me. At that moment, I must have reached a very high level of subspace. I started to tremble and remember very intense emotions. Even my memories from this part of the session are blurred and I can’t recall the exact order in which everything happened. At the start, Goddess skillfully hooked me up to an electro device, I believe with pads on both my balls and my cock. I did experience electro before, but never this intense. At the one hand the contraction of muscles caused by the electric pulses were painful, but on the other hand the pulses made me feel like I was getting a blowjob; such contradiction! I was helplessly groaning with every set of pulses. With my tong I remember feeling that my mask had a stiff ring around the mouth opening, making sure that Goddess had full access to my mouth. For some time my mouth was even kept open by a Jennings gag. Again a device I never experienced before, but absolutely loved. Goddess was regularly spitting in my mouth and if I could have spoken, I would have begged her for more. While all of this was going on, she also tried various butt plugs on me; both vibrating and electro. To make penetration easier, she gave me a few doses of poppers, supplied via a medical mask inhaler. She turned me into a real fan of medical play here! For Goddess I happily took the strong pain associated with taking some of these plugs out. At some point, Goddess removed the mask, so that I could see the peculiar situation I was in. However, all I could focus on was her. She was still moving around very erotically in her beautiful red leather play suit and every now and then showing me a bit more of her divine body. Being teased to such extend and still feeling the ‘blowjob’ from the electro play, I begged Goddess to turn of the electric pulses as I was afraid that I would come without permission. She told me I wouldn’t and quickly tried to give me a dose of nitrous oxide, but it was too late. I couldn’t believe I had come without her even touching me, but at the </span><span class="markuphainv5s" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">sam</span><span class="">e time it was such a wonderful, out of this world experience! </span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">Goddess was quick to point out that if this wouldn’t have happened, she might have let me worship her. Luckily, she told me earlier that she would let me come in suspension and she quickly moved on to make it her mission to still let that happen. She got undressed completely, freed up one of my hands and allowed my finger to carefully enter her vagina. I felt so privileged to admire her full body and to see her gorgeous bottom from that close. I even got to taste her juices as she instructed me to suck my finger. Clearly she was still having lots of fun and it didn’t take too long for my cock to harden again. </span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">In this state, she took me downstairs into her prison cell. I had to lie down on a soft table, hands tied on my front and still wearing my tight corset. She made me wear feet suspension cuffs and before I knew it I was hanging upside down. I had no energy left in me and I was in total obedience of Goddess. I remember being moved around, licking her feet and again admiring Goddess, but this time from underneath. I didn’t know what was coming when she moved me really close to her and all of the sudden I got a very powerful shot of her champagne right over my face and even into my nose. This must have been the most humiliating moment of the 3 hours,  but at the </span><span class="markuphainv5s" data-markjs="true" data-ogac="" data-ogab="" data-ogsc="" data-ogsb="">sam</span><span class="">e time I felt so happy and thankful that Goddess was willing to share this with me. Next moment I remember is being milked and again coming with so much joy. The session ended appropriately with me eating my cum out of her hands.</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">What a fantastic end to -and I’m not exaggerating- one of the best 3 hours in my life! I really hope you had fun as well and that you will allow me to be your Lagertha again. I can’t thank you enough for this wonderful time! </span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">Warm regards,</span><br class=""><span class="">Lagertha</span><br class=""><br class=""><span class="">PS. Your whip was more powerful than expected and left red horizontal stripes on my bottom for weeks :-) This required a bit of hiding, but was a small sacrifice to make for the great time you have given me!</span></p>
